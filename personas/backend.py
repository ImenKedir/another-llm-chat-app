# # Hosting Mixtral 8x7B with Text Generation Inference (TGI)
#
# In this example, we show how to run an optimized inference server using [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)
# with performance advantages over standard text generation pipelines including:
# - continuous batching, so multiple generations can take place at the same time on a single container
# - PagedAttention, an optimization that increases throughput.
#
# This example deployment, [accessible here](https://modal-labs--tgi-mixtral.modal.run), can serve Mixtral 8x7B on two 80GB A100s, with
# up to 500 tokens/s of throughput and per-token latency of 78ms.

# ## Setup
#
# First we import the components we need from `modal`.

import subprocess
from pathlib import Path

from modal import Image, Mount, Stub, asgi_app, gpu, method

# Next, we set which model to serve, taking care to specify the GPU configuration required
# to fit the model into VRAM, and the quantization method (`bitsandbytes` or `gptq`) if desired.
# Note that quantization does degrade token generation performance significantly.
#
# Any model supported by TGI can be chosen here.
GPU_CONFIG = gpu.A100(memory=40, count=4)
MODEL_ID = "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
# Add `["--quantize", "gptq"]` for TheBloke GPTQ models.
LAUNCH_FLAGS = [
    "--model-id",
    MODEL_ID,
    "--port",
    "8000",
]

# ## Define a container image
#
# We want to create a Modal image which has the Huggingface model cache pre-populated.
# The benefit of this is that the container no longer has to re-download the model from Huggingface -
# instead, it will take advantage of Modal's internal filesystem for faster cold starts.
# The 95GB model can be loaded in as little as 70 seconds.
#
# ### Download the weights
# We can use the included utilities to download the model weights (and convert to safetensors, if necessary)
# as part of the image build.
def download_model():
    subprocess.run(
        [
            "text-generation-server", "download-weights", MODEL_ID
        ]
    )


# ### Image definition
# Weâ€™ll start from a Dockerhub image recommended by TGI, and override the default `ENTRYPOINT` for
# Modal to run its own which enables seamless serverless deployments.
#
# Next we run the download step to pre-populate the image with our model weights.
#
# Finally, we install the `text-generation` client to interface with TGI's Rust webserver over `localhost`.
image = (
    Image.from_registry("ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:1.3.1")
    .dockerfile_commands("ENTRYPOINT []")
    .run_function(download_model, timeout=60 * 20)
    .pip_install("text-generation")
)

stub = Stub("example-tgi-mixtral", image=image)


# ## The model class
#
# The inference function is best represented with Modal's [class syntax](/docs/guide/lifecycle-functions).
# The class syntax is a special representation for a Modal function which splits logic into two parts:
# 1. the `__enter__` method, which runs once per container when it starts up, and
# 2. the `@method()` function, which runs per inference request.
#
# This means the model is loaded into the GPUs, and the backend for TGI is launched just once when each
# container starts, and this state is cached for each subsequent invocation of the function.
# Note that on start-up, we must wait for the Rust webserver to accept connections before considering the
# container ready.
#
# Here, we also
# - specify how many A100s we need per container
# - specify that each container is allowed to handle up to 10 inputs (i.e. requests) simultaneously
# - keep idle containers for 10 minutes before spinning down
# - lift the timeout of each request.

# You can try our deployment [here](https://modal-labs--tgi-mixtral.modal.run).
